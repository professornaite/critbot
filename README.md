# CritBot

CritBot is a user-friendly database interface for critical theory terms
and keywords. Users can check if a keyword is in the database, agree or
disagree with its definition, and propose alternative definitions. These
can be saved in a CSV file for future reference.

### Procedures

A user is able to follow three steps:

1.  check to see if a keyword is in our database,

2.  agree or disagree with the definition of that keyword, and

3.  if the user disagrees, the user can offer an alternative definition.

This alternative definition can be entered and saved into a .csv file.

The user can repeat steps (1) - (3) as many times as they'd like.

Each alternative definition will be saved in a single CSV.

We request that use send us that .csv file to help us expand our
databases.

You can email your file to us as quantshopusers [at] gmail [dot] com.
