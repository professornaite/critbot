# CritBot

CritBot is a user-friendly database interface for exploring critical
terms and keywords. This version of the app provides a static,
read-only view, allowing users to check definitions of predefined terms
and express agreement or disagreement with those definitions.

### Procedures

A user is able to follow the below algorithm:

1.  Check if a keyword is in our database.

2.  View the definition of that keyword.

3.  Indicate whether they agree or disagree with the provided
    definition. (Note: Alternative definitions cannot be submitted in
    this version.)

### Contributing

This version of CritBot is a template static app designed for easy deployment on
platforms like GitHub Pages. As such, it does not support dynamic
updates or the addition of new terms through the interface.

We welcome contributions to expand our database and improve existing
definitions! Please email your suggestions or updated term lists to
quantshopusers [at] gmail [dot] com. Your input will help us improve
future versions of CritBot.
